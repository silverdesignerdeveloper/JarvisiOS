An all around wireless home automation project using a Rails server & IFTTT with features such as 
push button, geofencing, face detection, and SiriKit(coming next month). The only thing I have it 
operating now are my living room lights. Feel free to use this as a jumpoff point for your ideas.
Built with XCode 8, Swift 3, Alamofire 4 & SwiftyJSON. Guillotine for the navigation. The rails app
is hosted on Heroku & the repository is on this Githubs home page. Questions : Hart87@gmail.com
